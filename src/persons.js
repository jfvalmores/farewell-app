Been extremely educative to see your brilliance - from low level programming decisions to more high level design choices. This combined with your sympathetic and peace minded persona is one of a kind. A great loss for PostNord. See you soon again! 😁`,

    I especially liked how no issue was too small to discuss and I could always ask you a question without feeling like I was wasting your time. 
    You managed to teach me kubernetes, observability and oidc, which without your guidance I would have struggled to do so. 
    I know that I could have learned much more if we had more time. 🎉🎉🎉`,
